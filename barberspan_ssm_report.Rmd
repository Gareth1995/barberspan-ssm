A summary will go here

### Introduction {-}
With the ongoing concern about biodiversity loss, monitoring biodiversity at various levels of biological organisation is important [@pereira2013essential]. At the organismal level, biodiversity is generally measured by three components: number of species, total number of individuals (abundance), and how the individuals are distributed across species (evenness). We lose biodiversity if abundance decreases, if species go extinct, if communities become dominated by a few common species, or a combination of these processes. To measure changes in biodiversity, we need indicators that are sensitive to changes in these components [@bucklandMonitoringChangeBiodiversity2005; @buckland2017measuring]. 

One type of index that is sensitive to these three aspects of biodiversity change is based on aggregated species trends [@buckland2011geometric]. Let $n_i$ be the number of individuals of species $i$ and $n = \sum_{i=1}^S n_i$ the total number of individuals of $S$ species in the community, so that $i = 1, \ldots , S$. Evenness measures how uniform the species proportions $p_i$ are, where $p_i = n_i /n$. Now consider surveying a single location and counting the individuals of a group of species over time. The counts $n_{i,j}$ are the number of individuals encountered of species $i$ in year $j$. Because population growth is a multiplicative process, changes in $n_i$ over time are best measured as ratios $n_{i,j+1}/n_{i,j}$. Trends in the abundance of individual species can then be aggregated using the geometric mean [@buckland2011geometric] or equivalently, the arithmetic mean of the changes in log abundances $G_j = exp \left( \frac{1}{S}\sum_{i=1}^S log \frac{n_{i,j+1}}{n_{i,j}}\right)$. The well-known Living Planet Index, for example, is based on the geometric mean [@lohLivingPlanetIndex2005; @mcraeDiversityWeightedLivingPlanet2017] even though it measures change against a baseline, rather than from one year to the next.

The geometric mean weights all species trends equally and is therefore sensitive to small clusters of species with extreme trends [@leungClusteredCatastrophicGlobal2020]. It is also sensitive to trends in rare species, which are often difficult to estimate well [@buckland2017measuring]. An alternative approach for measuring change in biodiversity is to calculate a biodiversity index for each year and then examine changes in this index over time. Many measures of diversity exist but the ones that can be interpreted as the effective number of species seem the most intuitive ones [@jost2006entropy]. One family of such diversity measures is the Hill numbers [@hillDiversityEvennessUnifying1973]:

$$^qD = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{S}p_i^q \right) ^{1/(1-q)}$$
By varying the free parameter $q$, the Hill numbers are species richness for $q = 0$, the exponentiated Shannon entropy for $q=1$ and the inverse of Simpson's index for $q=2$.

When estimating trends in biodiversity, it is important to take into account the observation process that has given rise to the data. In most situations, it is impossible to census wild populations completely. We would like to know the number of individuals of species $i$, i.e. $n_{i,t}$, that is present in a population in year $t$. Instead, we obtain a count $c_{i,t}$ that is related to $n_{i,t}$ as $c_{i,t} = n_{i,t} \times p_{i,t}$ where $p_{i,t}$ is a detection rate. The observation process has three effects on the observed counts. 1) since $p_{i,t}$ usually varies because of variable conditions like weather, visibility, observer skills, characteristics of a species, etc., the counts are more variable than the actual population sizes [@link1994importance]. 2) The $p_{i,t}$ vary because some individuals escape detection and others might be double counted. Often, non-detection is a bigger issue than double counting and so the $p_{i,t}$ tend to be $<1$. As a result, the raw counts tend to underestimate the true population sizes. 3) Sometimes, surveys are missed altogether, leading to $p_{i,t} = 0$ for all species in a particular year $t$.

Here, we explore trends in waterbird populations at a particular wetland, Barberspan, in South Africa. Waterbirds are an important component of biodiversity in wetlands and also often serve as indicators for the condition of their environment [@amatWaterbirdsBioindicatorsEnvironmental2010; @gregoryWildBirdIndicators2010; @sekerciogluIncreasingAwarenessAvian2006], such as the level of eutrophication of wetlands [@amatWaterbirdsBioindicatorsEnvironmental2010]. Waterbids are also notoriously difficult to count as they tend to flock and can uncoo.peratively fly around during surveys. The waterbirds at Barberspan have been counted twice per year, in mid winter and mid-summer, since 1993. However, as is often the case in long-term monitoring programmes, counts were not always carried out and the time series therefore contain gaps. We therefore estimate population sizes and their trends using state-space models to reduce the effect of the observation process [@auger-metheGuideStatespaceModeling2021]. We then calculate indices for biodiversity change by aggregating population trends and using biodiversity indicators.

### Methods {-}
#### Study Area {-}

The bird counts used in this study come from the Barberspan wetland (add rough coordinates). The Barberspan wetland is situated in North West province, South Africa. It is a protected wetland site known as Barberspan Bird Sanctuary that covers a 3200ha area. The wetland is centered on a shallow lake which covers approximately 257ha to 2000ha depending on rain fall [@remisiewiczStatusMigrantResident2011].

RAMSAR reports that the Barberspan wetland regularly supports approximately 20000 waterbirds with 365 different bird species [@rothmannjBarberspan2015]. Barberspan was one of the first RAMSAR sites in South Africa and the only RAMSAR site in North West province. 

During the austral summer ???, Barberspan wetland is home to thousands of Little Stints and Curlew Sandpipers. It also attracts intra-African nomadic waders such as Kittlitz's Plover and Crowned Lapwing. The bird species with the highest abundance in Barperspan wetland are: Red-Knobbed Coot, Egyptian Goose, Yellow Billed Duck, Southern Pochard and South African Shelduck [@remisiewiczStatusMigrantResident2011]. Appendix A contains further information regarding the waterbirds found in Barberspan wetland and were used in this study. 

ToDo: write a bit more about climate, when rainfall season, how much rain, types of habitat surroundings



#### Waterbird Count Data  {-}
The data used in this paper are from the Coordinated Waterbird Counts (CWAC) initiative (add website). The counts are conducted twice a year, once in January/February (austral
summer) and once in June/July (austral winter). The counting procedure is standardised and follows a rigorous set of instructions that counters are to follow. The counting protocol is such that all counts take place at approximately the same time of day, when the sun is either behind or beside the counter (????). More details about the counting process can be found at <https://cwac.birdmap.africa/>.

The CWAC dataset contains bird counts from 1993 to 2013 (can we use later counts ????) for the Barberspan wetland. Only birds with 15 or more non-zero counts were used in the analysis as the variance parameters for the state-space time series model didn't converge when applied to bird counts with fewer than 15 non-zero counts.


Todo:
- how many count occasions
- how many missing
- 18 summer counts, 13 winter counts

#### State-Space Time Series Model {-}

State-space models have become increasingly popular tools in modelling population dynamics [@auger-metheGuideStatespaceModeling2021]. The key benefit of a state-space model is its ability to separate observation error and latent error. By removing the observation error from the latent error, one is able to predict population trends more accurately [@keryBayesianPopulationAnalysis2011a]. SSMs are an ideal tool to use for time series analysis for the CWAC dataset, as bird counts are often prone to high levels of observation error and follow a Markovian process, where the value at time $t$ is dependent on the value at time $t-1$ (see \ref{fig:ssm-illustration} for illustration of Markov chain).


Todo: 
- I think we can skip this figure ??
- add references to TRIM, Rtrim (also state-space models)
- move above paragraph to intro, as justification for state-space model, approach
- explain log(count + 1)
- are the winter counts used at all? do they add information? add precision to estimates? if not, leave out?

  \label{fig:ssm-illustration}
\end{figure}

The state-space model used in this study is based on that developed by @barshepIdentifyingEcologicalLifehistory2017 and applied to bird count data in the CWAC dataset. This is a bivariate time series model that treats summer and winter counts as two interdependent time series. 


SSMs model the state process and observation process separately such that state error and observation error can be separated for more accurate modelling of the count data. 

We fitted the following state-space model:

_observation process_

\begin{equation}
  ln(summer\;count): s_{t} = \mu_{t-1} + \alpha_{t},\;\;\;\alpha_{t} \sim N(0,\sigma^{2}_\alpha)
\end{equation}

<!-- wouldn't this make more sense if it's mu_t - lambda_t? -->
\begin{equation}
  ln(winter\;count): w_{t} = \mu_{t} + \lambda_{t} + e_{t},\;\;\;e_{t} \sim N(0,\sigma^{2}_e)
\end{equation}

\textcolor{red}{code has -lambda for above equation}


_state process_

\begin{equation}
  ln(summer\;population\;level): \mu_{t} = \mu_{t-1} + \beta_{t-1} + w_{t}, \;\;\; w_{t} \sim N(0, \sigma^{2}_w)
\end{equation}

\textcolor{red}{code has -beta for above equation}

\begin{equation}
  ln(population\;change): \beta_{t} = \beta_{t-1} + \zeta_{t}, \;\;\; \zeta_{t} \sim N(0, \sigma^{2}_\zeta)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  ln(summer\;to\;winter\;ratio): \lambda_{t} = \lambda_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}, \;\;\; \epsilon_{t} \sim N(0,\sigma^{2}_\epsilon)
\end{equation}

where, $s_{t}$ is the summer count at time $t$ and $w_{t}$ is the winter count at time $t$. $\mu_{t}$ is the latent summer population, $\beta_{t}$ is the rate of change at time $t$ and $\lambda_t$ is the winter to summer ratio. The winter to summer ratio refers to the difference in the bird population from summer to winter. Palearctic migrants usually migrate north before the austral winter. However, many of young birds stay behind, thus leaving a smaller proportion of birds in the South African wetlands in winter compared to summer.  


\textcolor{red}{this model was originally used in Simmons et al??}

\textcolor{red}{the majority of birds at Barberspan are not actually migrants, especially not the common ones. Then does this summer-winter ssm make sense? Maybe okay if there is a difference between summer and winter, for whatever reason?}

\textcolor{red}{from indicator perspective: are the winter counts interesting at all? contribute any information?}

We assume that the error terms $\alpha_{t}$, $e_{t}$, $w_{t}$, $\zeta_{t}$ and $\epsilon_{t}$ are all normally distributed, serially independent and independent of each other with variances $\sigma^{2}_\alpha$, $\sigma^{2}_e$, $\sigma^{2}_w$, $\sigma^{2}_\zeta$ and $\sigma^{2}_\epsilon$, respectively.

To account for species that leave the area during the austral winter, winter counts are modelled as a proportion of the previous summer count. 

We fitted the above model using a Bayesian approach, implemented using Gibbs sampling in JAGS through R [@plummerJAGSProgramAnalysis2003; @R; @jagsui; @coroGibbsSamplingJAGS2017]. We used three chains, of length 10000, 5000 burnin samples. 

obtain posterior distribution for .... which important values that will be extracted??


#### Biodiversity indices {-}


The Living Planet Index (LPI) can track
changes in population sizes over time. The LPI is used as an aggregated abundance index. It
calculates the percentage change from a reference year (1970 \textcolor{red}{??? why 1970, we don't have the data for 1970 ???}) to all subsequent years. This is done by
averaging the rate of change (from reference year to current year) across all species of a species group
[@mcraeDiversityWeightedLivingPlanet2017].

\textcolor{red}{??? if this study doesn't use the original LPI, then don't call it LPI}

\textcolor{red}{rather call it something else, e.g. average rate of change or average population change per group or for species i}


\textcolor{red}{is this an abundance index? seems more like a population change index}

For each year and every species (or group of species) we calculated the percentage change in .... relative to the previous year. These changes were averaged over species. 

\begin{equation}
  \overline{d_t}=\frac{1}{n_t}\sum_{i=1}^{n_t}d_{it}
\end{equation}

where $\overline{d_t}$ is the average annual trend if there were multiple population time series of the same species. $n_t$ refers to the number of populations. $d_{t}$ is the annual rate of change for a population at time $t$, and is represented as follows: 

\begin{equation}
  d_{t}=log_{10}\left(\frac{N_{t}}{N_{t-1}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $N_{t}$ refers to the population size during year t.

The values for $N_t$ were extracted from the posterior sample obtained from the state-space model. 

We extracted the mean, and 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles from this posterior distribution to obtain a mean and credible interval for the index. 


The exponentiated Shannon index and the Simpson index was also used to calculate further aspects of biodiversity in Barberspan. Namely the evenness and effective number of bird species. This is calculated using the Simpson's index and exponentiated Shannon's index respectivley [@nagendraOppositeTrendsResponse2002]. The calculations for the Shannon's index and the Simpson's index is displayed as follows:

_Shannon's index_

\begin{equation}
  x=-\sum_{i=1}^Sp_iln(p_i)
\end{equation}

where $x$ is the index, $p_i$ is the proportion of species $i$ in the sample and $S$ is the number of species in the sample.

_Simpsons index_

\begin{equation}
  x=\sum_{i=1}^Sp_i^2
\end{equation}


\textcolor{red}{explain how $p_i$ is related to values in posterior, is posterior needed here?, equation}

\textcolor{red}{Calculating these indices from the posterior distribution:}

The 10 000 approximated count values for each bird count per year was used in calculating the modified LPI, exponentiated Shannon index and the Simpson index. 

The Shannon and Simpson index were applied to the posterior values generated from the Gibbs sampler in similar manner as the modified LPI calculations. An exponentiated Shannon and Simpson index was calculated per year, using all 10 000 posterior count values for each bird species for that year. Thus creating 10 000 index values for each year. The mean index value was taken for both Shannon and Simpson values and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were calculated to form the credible intervals.


### Results {-}
The combined bird counts of Barberspan from 1993 to 2018 are plotted in figure 2. The plot is broken up into summer and winter counts due to the biannual data capturing process that  the CWAC protocols require. The plot shows fairly random variations of bird counts over the years, for both summer and winter counts, with multiple missing values in the dataset. Applying the state-space time series model to this data will approximate these missing values based on the previous existing values.

A state-space time series model was fit to the combined bird counts of the Barberspan wetland using the JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) package. The model was fit on the summer and winter counts separately. The output is posterior distributions for summer and winter counts for each year. The state-space time series model output is displayed in figure 4.

\textcolor{red}{would it make sense to add horizontal reference lines, e.g. overall mean, early mean. Then one can see at any point whether the values are different to that reference level. Could add the actual number (number of birds instead of log count)}

\textcolor{red}{make plots simpler, fewer grid lines}

From the 10 000 yearly count values generated from the Gibbs Sampler, we are able to calculate various bioindices. We demonstrate the benefits of using posterior output to calculate bioindices by calculating the LPI, exponentiated Shannon index and the Simpson index using the 10 000 yearly posterior values.

An LPI is calculated for each year and the mean, 2.5th and 97.5th percentile is generated from the 10 000 LPI values generated for each year. The output of this LPI calculations is shown in figure 5.

\end{figure}

The exponentiated Shannon index was also calculated using the posterior output. An exponentiated Shannon index was calculated for each year. This resulted in 10 000 exponentiateed Shannon index values for each year. The mean, 2.5th and 97.5th percentile was then calculated from the 10 000 index values. The same approach was conducted when calculating the Simpson index for each year. The outputs of the exponentiated Shannon and Simpson index calculations are displayed in figure 6 and 7 respectively.

### Discussion

Wetlands are valuable ecosystems for society [@clarksonWetlandEcosystemServices2013]. Unfortunately,
there has been global wetland degradation with about half of the global wetlands being lost to
accommodate for agricultural practices and urbanisation. The loss of wetlands has a negative impact
on biodiversity, human well-being and has negative long-term impacts on economies [@clarksonWetlandEcosystemServices2013]. This has given rise to many wetland conservation projects, both locally (Working for Wetlands project) and globally (RAMSAR and AEWA).

A particularly effective method for tracking environmental changes within these ecosystems is through the use of bird species abundance as bioindicators. Birds are sensitive to various environmental changes and can thus provide direct reflections of ecosystem health [@mekonenBirdsBiodiversityEnvironmental2017; @amatWaterbirdsBioindicatorsEnvironmental2010]. In this study, we employed the state-space time series model to analyze bird abundance, utilizing the posterior output to calculate index values that measure population rate of change, diversity, and the expected number of bird species. This modeling approach offers a robust method for analyzing bird counts over time, as it distinguishes between latent and observation errors, thereby providing a clearer picture of true population dynamics [@auger-metheGuideStatespaceModeling2021].

An additional advantage of using the state-space time series model is the ability to derive posterior distributions of bird counts, which can then be used to calculate index values with credible intervals. In our analysis, we calculated the Living Planet Index (LPI), Simpson Index, and Exponentiated Shannon Index to assess annual percentage population changes, community evenness, and the effective number of bird types at Barberspan, respectively. This flexibility allows conservation managers to compute any index relevant to their specific objectives, and the credible intervals associated with these indices enhance the reliability of the measurements.

Moreover, the state-space model allows for the incorporation of known biological patterns into the data analysis. In this study, we accounted for migratory patterns by including seasonal migrations of birds from South African wetlands during the winter. This aspect of the model helps to refine the accuracy of our population estimates and index calculations.

While our findings demonstrate the utility of state-space models in assessing bird abundance, there is room for further research. Future studies could apply these methods to different environments to broaden the applicability of our approach. Additionally, efforts should be made to reduce the variance in the models, as our index outputs occasionally displayed large error bands. By refining these models and expanding their application, we can improve our understanding of bird populations and contribute more effectively to wetland conservation efforts.

In conclusion, the state-space time series model proves to be a powerful tool in the analysis of bird abundance, offering detailed insights and reliable index values that can inform conservation strategies. As we continue to refine these models and expand their use, we enhance our ability to protect and preserve vital wetland ecosystems for future generations.
